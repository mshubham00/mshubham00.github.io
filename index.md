**Galactic Neighbours**

Galaxies containing billions of stars, wandering in different directions of the sky. Residing in the Milky Way, we can not see our home galaxy but other ones for sure! Like our neighboring galaxy Andromeda, M31. Isn't it look beautiful? 

Andromeda is double in the size and age of Milky Way. There exist even bigger and older galaxies, just need to seek deeper in the space and you will find many. Seeing all these chaos, I feel lost sometimes and wish to make a map of my neighborhood. For that, measuring distances to galaxies seems right thing to do, but how to proceed further? 

Sit and observe the night sky. Observe for hours and take pictures. On comparing such pictures, it was found that some star changes brightness periodically. One of the first such star observed in consellation Cephus, hence family of such stars are named as Cephied stars. While developing a catalog of variable stars, in 1908, Henry Leavitt noticed a correlation between changing brightness and pulsating period of Cepheids. The linear equation correlating intrinsic brightness of Cepheid with their period is known as Leavitt Law. It is one of the most  robust method to find distances to galaxies, provided they host Cepheid variables. 

**Research Work**

My master research work aims to refined this century old method to achieve more reliable measurement of distances to distant galaxies. New technology and high standard data from space-based telescope opens up possibility to gain more accuracy in distance measurement. Focusing on Cepheids residing in the Milky Way, I determined the systematic errors in emperical Leavitt Law using multiband photometry data and pre-determined distances from Gaia satellite. With the calibrated Galactic Leavitt Law, comparision of Leavitt Law of other galaxies yields a difference in their zeropoint. This difference gives the distances of respective galaxy and ultimately helps me to locate galaxies in the space. It helps me to realise where am I.
