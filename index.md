Galaxies containing billions of stars are spread in all directions of the sky. We live in Milky Way galaxy and the above image shows our neighboring galaxy Andromeda, M31. Isn't it look beautiful? 

M31 is double in size and age of Milky Way. There can be even more bigger and older galaxies,as we seek deeper in the space. Seeing all these, I feel lost sometimes and wish make a map of my neighborhood. For that, measuring distances to galaxy seems right thing to do. 

My master research work aims to build such a tool which can measure reliable distances to distant galaxies. The tool I am working with is century old, with new technology, high standard data have been gathered which helps to gain more accuracy.
